# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a "first shader" project directory that appears to be in an initial or reset state. The directory currently contains only configuration files for Claude Flow and Swarm systems.

## Architecture

The project uses:
- **Claude Flow**: AI agent coordination system (`.claude-flow/` directory)
- **Swarm**: Distributed AI system with memory database (`.swarm/` directory)

## Development Context

Based on git history, this project was previously part of a larger game development codebase with:
- Segment-based level implementation
- Enemy AI systems (Goomba, Koopa)
- Level design documents for World 1-1
- Asset management systems

The current directory structure suggests this is either:
1. A fresh start for shader development
2. A cleaned workspace for new shader experiments
3. Part of a larger project reorganization

## Expected Development

When shader code is added, typical patterns would include:
- Vertex shaders (`.vert` files)
- Fragment shaders (`.frag` files) 
- Shader programs and utilities
- WebGL or graphics framework integration

## Claude Flow Integration

The presence of Claude Flow metrics indicates this project may use AI-assisted development workflows for shader creation and optimization.
